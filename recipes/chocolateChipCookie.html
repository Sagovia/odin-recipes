        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a simple recipe for some classic chocolate chip cookies. They can be made thinner if you prefer a crunchier cookie, but can also be made in thicker chunks if you
            prefer a chewier, softer center. Feel free to experiment and add nuts, or toppings to add to the flavor.
        </p>
