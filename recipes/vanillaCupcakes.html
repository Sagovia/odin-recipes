        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Vanilla cupcakes are an easy go-to desert if you're not too experienced in baking but want to make something that still tastes decent.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>Unsalted Butter</li>
            <li>Granulated Sugar</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Baking Powder</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven (usually around 350°F or 180°C). Line a cupcake tin with paper liners.</li>
            <li>Gather and measure all the ingredients according to the recipe.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, cream together softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This can be done with an electric mixer or by hand.</li>
            <li>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated before adding the next.</li>
            <li>Mix in the vanilla extract to enhance the flavor of the cupcakes.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing just until combined. Alternate with adding the milk, starting and ending with the dry ingredients. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
            <li>Spoon or scoop the batter into the prepared cupcake liners, filling each about two-thirds full.</li>
            <li>Place the cupcake tin in the preheated oven and bake for the time specified in the recipe, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Allow the cupcakes to cool in the tin for a few minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Once the cupcakes are completely cool, you can frost them with your favorite icing or enjoy them plain.</li>
            <li>Serve your vanilla cupcakes and enjoy them as a delightful treat!</li>
        </ol>
